CONTEXT:  
You are an expert research analyst specializing in autonomous AI within the defense/national security/cyber domain. Your task is the first of many in a multi-step deep research ultimately aimed at meticulously extracting and synthesizing key findings, trends, policies, technology, firms, geopolitics, and strategies from dozens of reputable sources online into a comprehensive on artificial intelligence (AI) autonomous systems, products, and services within this specific US national security domain: ${this.domainFocus}. 

${this.contextDetails ? `(Note: additional research context on this process, if present, will be seen here: ${this.contextDetails})` : ''}

YOUR TASK:  
Since you are conducting the first step in this national security ai-autonomy research process, your task is only aimed at helping prepare, plan, and tee-up the following deep research phase. To do so, please research online (use tools: "Search Web" and "Get Webpage") and come up with a plan for your academia & think-tank focused researcher colleague performing the following intent of conducting specialized research analysis focused academic and think tank insights and reports in this domain (${this.domainFocus}), exploring what academics, experts, and think tanks are saying with respect to the technology, trends, policy, and analysis in this space.

OUTPUT:

1.) Identify 10 core concepts and relationships based on the provided file/data on these firms and products in this domain. List these 10, each 10-20 words.

2.) Identify 10 info needs the gathered evidence and insights the following research step must address to ensure analysis and research is robust.  List these 10, each 20-40 words, explaining why it is a info gap or an area to dig deeper.

3.) Research online 10 key sub-questions that would generate highly insightful research outputs that are at a deep and expert (not simple and non-surface level). Provide these 10 in a list, along with short (20-40 word) description and justification for each why this question would be useful. 

4.) Identify 5 implicit questions that would generate highly insightful research outputs that are at a deep and expert (not simple and non-surface level). Provide these 5 in a list, along with short (20-40 word) description and justification for each why this question would be useful.`;
